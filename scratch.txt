Here is how I got the data into my local database for querying with Prisma ORM.

  Open your <data>.json and just place the whole dang thing in one array: ```[
                                                                                    {
    First install jq globally to your machine. `$ npm i jq -g`                        "key" : val,
                                                                                      "key" : val,
        Ensure you're in the directory your data.json file lives.                     //...
        
        Then run the following jq command to create a CSV copy of your json data. Yes, this will include any and all null values (jq default feature)

    jq -r '.[] | [
      .field_a,
      .field_fubar,
      .fubar_b,
      ....,
    ] | @csv' example.json > output.csv

    then, still on your CL run psql to enter a postgresql terminal session

    CREATE DATABASE...CREATE TABLE(schematize)...

    command for creating table (Yes, TIMESTAMP will preserve the value of 'accepted_datetime_utc''s UTC format down to the millisecond ->  postgresql documentation):

    CREATE TABLE <name_of_table> (
        field_a INTEGER,
        field_fubar TEXT,
        fubar_b FLOAT
        ...,
    );

    Still in your postgresql session, let's insert all the records that are in our CSV file into our database table.

    COPY <name_of_table> (
      field_a,
      field_fubar,
      fubar_b,
      ...
    )
    FROM '<path_to_csv_file>' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    Now all your records are in your postgresql database, you should be good to go
